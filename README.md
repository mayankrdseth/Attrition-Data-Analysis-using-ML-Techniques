1. Preprocessed the data by removing skewness and treating outliers.

2. Engineered various features to accommodate their characteristics in the model using label encoder, one-hot encoder and 

3. Applied SVC, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Voting classifier and compared the results based on accuracy, recall, F1 score and confusion matrix.

4. Used PCA for feature reduction, applied undersampling, oversampling and SMOTE to treat imbalance in data.

5. Computed feature importance after analysing the results.
